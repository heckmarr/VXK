This is a historical repository of
Oculus Quest 2 .apks

These should always be considered working, if only in a broken state.

Two builds of note are VeArrHacker 0.4.0 and TypeHack 0.4.1 0.4.8 and 0.4.10

Tested on my devices and built in Canada.

TypeHack is the leading candidate for how I want to implement a 
floating keyboard. I will release the full source of it when I 
feel it is mature enough.

To install these on your Oculus Quest 2, install the MQDH and 
drag and drop, then launch either through the app or by
selecting your apps, then filtering "by unknown"
